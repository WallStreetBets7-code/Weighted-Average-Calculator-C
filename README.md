# Weighted-Average-Calculator-C
This program will take a user-defined number of weighted average categories for their class e.g. homework, tests, exams, etc.
This program expects the numerical user inputs to be strictly numerical. No special symbols. If scanf detects anything other than a numerical input it will exit the program. 
It is preferred to name the data in a .txt file. Example: "GradeOuput.txt"
